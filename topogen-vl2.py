# VL2 topology generator
#  Generate a k-core VL2 network as described by the following paper as `folded
#  Clos network':
#    A. Greenberg, S. Kandula, D. A. Maltz, J. R. Hamilton, C. Kim, P. Patel,
#    N. Jain, P. Lahiri and S. Sengupta, `VL2: A Scalable and Flexible Data
#    Center Network.' In Proc. SIGCOMMâ€™09, August 17-21, 2009, Barcelona,
#    Spain.
#  The topology has k cores in the network, and 2k aggregation switches. They form a
#  complete bipartite graph. There are 4k edge switches, each connects to two
#  aggregation switches. The edge i connects to aggregation floor(i/k) and
#  aggregation k+(i mod k).
# The format is
#    N <nodeid>
#    N <nodeid>
#    ...
#    l <nodeid> <nodeid>
#    l <nodeid> <nodeid>
#    ...
